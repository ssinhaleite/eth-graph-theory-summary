# ETH Graph Theory Summary

Here you can find the explanations and definitions to summarize the content of the lecture about Graph Theory of Prof. Dr. Benjamin Sudakov.

This course covers basic notions of graph, trees, spanning trees, Caley's formula, vertex and edge connectivity, blocks, 2-connectivity, Mader's theorem, Menger's theorem, Eulerian graphs, Hamilton cycles, Dirac's theorem, matchings, theorems of Hall, KÃ¶nig and Tutte, planar graphs, Euler's formula, basic non-planar graphs, graph colorings, greedy colorings, Brooks' theorem, 5-colorings of planar graphs.

This course objective is give an overview over the most fundamental questions concerning graph theory. We expect them to understand the proof techniques and to use them autonomously on related problems.

In this course, the lectures are only at the blackboard.
